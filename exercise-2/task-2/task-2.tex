\section*{2. Time systems}

a) Define sideral time, true solar time and mean solar time.\\
\\
\\textbf{1. Sideral time:} The sideral time is the measure of time based on the Earth's rotation relative
to distant stars. A sideral day is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds.\\
\\
\\textbf{2. True solar time:} The true solar time is based on the position of the Sun in the sky. It 
varies throughout the year due to the Earth's elliptical orbit and axis tilt.\\
\\
\\textbf{3. Mean solar time:} The mean solar time, is the solar time that would be measured by 
observation if the Sun traveled at a uniform apparent speed throughout the year rather than, as it 
actually does as it's speed is varying slightly.\\
\\
b) Calculate the difference between the civil time and mean solar time for the following cities: Berlin
$\lambda = 13.40 \degree$ E; Barcelona $\lambda = 2.16 \degree$ E; Warsaw $\lambda = 21.012 \degree$ E.
Note all these cities follow the same time zone (CET) defined by meridian with longitude 
$\lambda = 15 \degree$ E.\\
