\section*{4. Luminosity}

a) What do you understand by irradiance? Calculate the irradiance received from the Sun above the 
absorbing atmospheres of planet Mercury, Earth, and Uranus. Given, luminosity of the Sun 
$L_\odot = 3.839 \times 10^{26}W$.\\
\\
b) The irradiance received by the Sun above the Earth's atmosphere per unit area, is also known as the
"solar irradiance". Find the distance from where a 60-Watt lightbulb has its irradiance equal to the solar
irradiance.\\
\\
c) The energy emitted per second by a star is $L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4_{eff} = S \sigma T^4_{eff}$, where
$S$ is the surface area of the star. A person also emits radiation. Under normal conditions, the 
temperature of the human body is around $37 \degree C$ or $T \approx 310 K$. An area of a person's body
is on the order of $S \approx 1.7 m^2$. What is the energy emitted per second by a person and what is the
characteristic wavelength of this emission?\\
