\section*{3. The Virial Theorem}

a) In space there are many gravitationally bound systems. If a system is roughly in equilibrium, the 
Virial Theorem states that the kinetic energy is equal to minus one half the potential energy 
$(\langle T \rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \langle V \rangle)$. Consider a light particle in a circular orbit
around a heavier one. Prove the Virial Theorem from this system's equation of motion.\\
