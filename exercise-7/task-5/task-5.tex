a) \textbf{Galaxy Structure}\\
A stellar disk is an essentially spherical population of field stars and spiral arms thought to sorround
most disk galaxies. A low amount (about 1\%) of a galaxy's stellar mass resides in the bulge, it 
generally has no net rotation and is supported almost entirely by velocity dispersion.\\
\\
b) \textbf{Elliptical Galaxies}
Which of the following is not a characteristics of Elliptical Galaxies?\\
A: Dominated by stars from Population I.\\
\\
c) \textbf{AGN}
Active galaxy nuclei are powered by:
Matter falling into a very massive black hole.\\
\\
d) \textbf{Dark Matter}
Which of the following evidences for Dark Matter are True?\\
I. Gravitational lensing, or the bending of the light, around Galaxy clusters implies the existence of an
unseen mass component.\\
II. There is not enough visible mass in Galaxy clusters to explain X-rays radiation emitted by hot gas.\\
III. The observed rotational curve of disk Galaxies in our universe cannot be explained only by the mass 
of stars and gas.\\
A: I, II and III are all true\\
\\
e) \textbf{Parallax}
Star A has a parallax of 0.5 arcsec. Find the distance to A in parsec.\\
A: 2 pc.\\
\\
f) \textbf{Distance modulus}
Calculate the distance, in parsec, of the globular cluster Omega Centauri using the relation between its
apparent magnitude ($m_v = 3.520$) and absolute magnitude ($M_V = -10.04$).\\
A: About 5200.
