\section*{4. Measuring galactic distances}

a) The cosmic distance ladder describe a chain of measurements that allows us to determine ever greater
distances to celestial objects. The distance determination methods in our universe include Cepheid 
variables, redshift, supernova Ia, radar ranging and parallax. List the methods for determining distances
in the correct order, from nearest to farthest.\\
