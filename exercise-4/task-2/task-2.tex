\section*{2. Energy Production in the Sun}

The sun generates its emitted energy by the fusion of hydrogen atoms to helium atoms. The dominating 
process to fuse helium, in sun-like stars, is generally known a the \textbf{p-p chain}. Comparing only
the initial and final products, this process can be described by the equation: 
$4H^+ \Rightarrow He^{++} + 2e^+ + 2v + \gamma$. The liberated energy in this process is roughly equal
to the mass difference between the helium and the 4 hydrogen atoms, which is also known as the mass 
defect.\\
\\
a) Calculate the mass defect, in a p-p chain reaction, in Joule and MeV.\\
\\
b) Calculate the energy liberated, if one 1 kg of helium is produced.\\
\\
c) The sun's age is roughly $4.6 \cdot 10^9$ years. Under the assumption that the solar luminosity didn't
change over the sun's lifetime, how much helium was produced so far? Compare this mass with the total 
solar mass of $M_\circlebullet = 2 \cdot 10^{30}$ kg.\\
