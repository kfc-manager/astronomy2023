\section*{4. Limiting magnitudes and light collecting power}

a) While on clear nights the human eye can only observe stars down to a limiting magnitude value of 6 mag,
fainter stars are observable using a telescope. This is due to the telescope's larger aperture compared
to the human eye and therefore more light collection. Calculate the limiting magnitude for an observer,
observing the sky through a telescope with an aperture of 50 cm. You can use that the human eye has an 
aperture size of 5 mm.\\
\\
b) Telescopes can be compared by their power to collect light. This power directly scales with the 
telescope's light collecting area. How much more light will be gathered by the currently constructed 
Extremely Large Telescope (aperture of 39 m) in comparison to the GRANTECAN telescope 
(aperture of 10.4 m), which has currently the largest single telescope aperture?\\
